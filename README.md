# F2-LEGGERO

The [LEGGERO](https://fondazione-restart.it/projects/f2-leggero/) project focuses on design and prototype of next generation of far edge routers, i.e. small routers deployed at the network customers’ sites to support mission-critical applications.
LEGGERO improvements are on three directions:

Lower cost and lower power consumption.
Higher reliability with the help of artificial intelligence. 
Support for cloud applications
The management platform will be able to deploy distributed applications on a large fleet of nodes.

LEGGERO is part of [Spoke 4 – Programmable Networks for Future Services and Media](https://fondazione-restart.it/organization/spoke-4-programmable-networks-for-future-services-and-media/)

| Title | Description | URL |
|-------|-------------|-----|
| A privacy-oriented Intrusion Detection System based on Zero-Knowledge Middleboxes | The Zero-Knowledge Middlebox (ZKMB) uses Zero-Knowledge Proof techniques to enable packet inspection without exposing packet contents, providing privacy-preserving intrusion detection. | https://github.com/bonsai-lab-polimi/zkIDS |
| A Middlebox for Verification of Encrypted FaaS Traffic | The Middlebox uses TMSP and Delegated Credentials to inspection of encrypted packets | https://github.com/bonsai-lab-polimi/tlmsp-dc-middlebox |
| NETTO | eBPF-based tool to monitor the CPU consumption of the Linux kernel's network stack in real-time | https://github.com/miolad/netto |
| SURE: Secure Unikernels Make Serverless Computing Rapid and Efficient | Framework to enable the secure and lightweight execution of serverless workloads on multi-tenant servers. | https://github.com/ucr-serverless/sure | 
| Orchestrator for distributed edge-to-cloud systems based on Heterogeneous Nodes in urban environment | The ONE system is composed of a Master Node, multiple Slave Gateways, and IoT Edge devices. The Master runs in Kubernetes, exposes a public HTTP endpoint, communicates with Azure IoT Hub to manage deployments, and orchestrates dynamic workloads. | https://github.com/CVLab-Uniss/ONE |
