# F2-LEGGERO

The [LEGGERO](https://fondazione-restart.it/projects/f2-leggero/) project focuses on design and prototype of next generation of far edge routers, i.e. small routers deployed at the network customers’ sites to support mission-critical applications.
LEGGERO improvements are on three directions:

Lower cost and lower power consumption.
Higher reliability with the help of artificial intelligence. 
Support for cloud applications
The management platform will be able to deploy distributed applications on a large fleet of nodes.

LEGGERO is part of [Spoke 4 – Programmable Networks for Future Services and Media](https://fondazione-restart.it/organization/spoke-4-programmable-networks-for-future-services-and-media/)
